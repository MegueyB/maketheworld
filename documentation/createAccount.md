1. Open the [Amazon Web Services home page](https://aws.amazon.com/).

2. Choose Create an AWS Account.  The name of the account can be whatever pleases you (that AWS will allow, that is).

Note: If you signed in to AWS recently, choose Sign in to the Console. If Create a new AWS account isn't visible, first choose Sign in to a different account, and then choose Create a new AWS account.

3. Enter your account information, and then choose Continue. Be sure that you enter your account information correctly, especially your email address. If you enter your email address incorrectly, you won't be able to access your account.

4. Choose Personal when given an option between Personal and Professional.

5. Enter your personal information.

6. Read and accept the AWS Customer Agreement.

7. Choose Create Account and Continue.

8. On the *Payment Information* page, add a payment method for any charges you accrue above the Free Tier.

9. Verify your phone number (so that AWS has some evidence you are a real person they could contact if they needed to)

10. AWS may well try to present you a "choice" of pricey Support Plans, because that's part of how they make profit.  You do not need one in order to proceed.

11. Wait to receive a confirmation email activating your account:  This usually only takes a few minutes, but can take longer if you have bad luck.

12. It can look like you’re all set when you still have two steps left: when you have the choice between Root and IAM (Identity and Access Management}, choose Root, and click the big orange button at the top right that says “Sign in to the Console”
